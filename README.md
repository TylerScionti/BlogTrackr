# BlogTrackr

Welcome to the first iteration of the Blog Trackr Premium app!

Blog Trackr's aim is to completely automate the content curation and branding process reducing the job of a team and investment of thousands of dollars down to a one-second button click. We do this by analyzing a website/blog's content for topics, content, keywords, and tone to search the web for comparable articles to craft a fully customized newsfeed. 

Blog Trackr is built in Python and uses the following libraries:
<ul>
<li>nltk</li>
<li>textblob</li>
<li>beautiful soup</li>
<li>scrapy</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>pygal</li>
</ul>

We use the Webhose.io API for our news search purposes to return the top articles for a given keyword. 

We have full app mockups for view <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4rQf9BppgNEejd2VmxjVHZqc28">here</a>

We hope you enjoy viewing our code!
